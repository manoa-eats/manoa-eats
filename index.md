# Overview
### The Problem
Not many students know about all of our fine dish eateries on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, some students who want to try new restaurants may not get a chance to because they may have time conflicts with their schedule leaving some restaurants having either too many students in line or not enough students. 

### The Solution
Manoa Eats will allow hardworking students to nourish their brains with UHâ€™s nutritious food located all around the campus. Students will be able to upload their schedules along with their course locations, and our website will estimate the best restaurant locations to stop at on their path to their next class.

# Mockups
### Mockup Landing Page
This landing page is the first mockup that was created during our first group meeting. It is a rough sketch of what we were thinking we wanted our landing page to look like. We wanted to keep it very simple and not too cluttered allowing people to visit our other tabs that we are envisioning our site will have.

After that meeting we then wanted to make a better mockup to have a cleaner look and allow for our landing page to match the theme we are envisioning.

### User Page
Our user page is where people are able to register and create an account. It is a very simple form that asks for your name, email, password, and if you want to add in a profile picture.

### I'm Feelin' Lucky Tab
This tab is meant to give the user a random restaurant and the details. They are always able to choose another restaurant at random if they do not like the one that was given.

### Write a Review
Users are able to leave reviews on the different restaurants so other users know what to except when going or if that place is a good fit for them.

### Adding a Vendor
Users are also able to add a restaurant they find to our existing list. They will have to input their name, location, hours of operations, a description, and if they want to upload anything to go along with the restaurant.
