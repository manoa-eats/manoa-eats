## Overview
### The Problem
Not many students know about all of our fine dish eateries on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, some students who want to try new restaurants may not get a chance to because they may have time conflicts with their schedule leaving some restaurants having either too many students in line. 

### The Solution
Manoa Eats will allow hardworking students to nourish their brains with UHâ€™s nutritious food located all around the campus. Students will be able to upload their schedules along with their course locations, and our website will estimate the best restaurant locations to stop at on their path to their next class.
